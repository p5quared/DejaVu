# Chronic Stocks
A site about stocks.

## How it works
#### \*TBD\*

## How it's made
This site was built with [Svelte/Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev) and [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev) and hosted via [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Developing

If, god forbid, you want to use this locally...
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
#or pnpm/yarn
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` (or pnpm/yarn).

> To deploy, you may need to select and install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment (I am using Vercel).
